==========

This repository is for public issue tracking relating to the [Materials Project](http://www.materialsproject.org) website. The code powering the website is kept in a seperate, private repository because it stores sensitive information such as authentication credentials for various services. We hope to one day open-source much of this code to help people independently build web apps that use [our API](https://materialsproject.org/open).

The issue tracker is [here](https://github.com/materialsproject/www-issues/issues).
